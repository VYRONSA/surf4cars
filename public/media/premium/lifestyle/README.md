# Lifestyle

People, and the part of their life a car is in. Used wherever the product needs to be about a person rather than a vehicle — and where a stock model would undo the whole effect.

**How assets arrive here:** Founder approval, and only Founder approval.

    node scripts/media/shortlist-candidates.mjs <brief-id>   # collect 3–5 candidates
    open http://localhost:3003/admin/creative/media-review   # review and approve

Nothing in this directory was chosen by software. Do not add, edit or overwrite a file here by
hand — an image that appears without an approval is an image nobody decided on, and the licence
and attribution the site renders come from the manifest, not from the file.

Taxonomy is defined in `scripts/media/lib/library.mjs`. Provenance for every approved asset is
recorded in `public/media/premium/manifest.json` and read by the application through
`src/config/media`. See `docs/experience-bible/10-creative-direction.md`.
